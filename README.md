This project is a React application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. It interacts with a mock API provided by JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to fetch, create, update, and delete user records.

Here's a brief overview of the project:
UserList Component: Displays a list of users fetched from the mock API. It includes functionality to add, edit, and delete users.
UserForm Component: Provides a form for adding new users or editing existing ones. The form includes input fields for the user's name, email, and phone number.

CRUD Operations:
Create: Users can add new records by filling out the form in the UserForm component and submitting it.
Read: Existing user records are fetched from the API and displayed in the UserList component.
Update: Users can edit existing records by clicking the "Edit" button next to each user in the list. The UserForm component is populated with the selected user's details, allowing for modification.
Delete: Users can delete existing records by clicking the "Delete" button next to each user in the list.

Styling:
The user list is styled using Bootstrap for layout and structure.
Custom CSS is used to add additional styling, including background color, box shadow, and other visual enhancements.

Functionality:
Asynchronous operations are handled using Axios to interact with the mock API.
React state is managed using hooks (useState) to keep track of user data and editing state.

Overall Structure:
The project follows a modular structure with separate components for displaying the user list (UserList) and managing user data (UserForm).
CSS files are kept separate to maintain clarity and organization.
Overall, this project provides a simple yet functional user interface for managing user data with a clean and responsive design. It demonstrates the basic principles of CRUD operations in a React application and integrates external APIs for data management.
